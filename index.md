# German for Credit 🇩🇪

Welcome! This hopefully helps to get you ready for achieving 2 language credits. To get to the level required to obtain these credits, you should try to study every day. I will try to post lessons for every day as much as possible.

Here are some useful links to the FCPS requirements for the language test:

- [Avant Assessment](https://www.avantassessment.com/fairfax)

#### Skills

To pass the test, you must be able to:

✔ understand everyday spoken German
✔ read simple authentic texts
✔ speak in short connected sentences
✔ write short paragraphs
✔ talk about past, present, and near future

STAMP is not grammar-test German. It is task-based.

#### Sections

A test will include 4 sections:

- **Reading**: Read emails, ads, short articles, stories → answer comprehension questions
- **Listening**: Hear conversations, announcements, interviews → answer questions
- **Writing**: Type responses to real-world prompts
- **Speaking**: Record spoken answers to prompts
  
Each day will conver all 4 sections. It might be slow and more difficult at first but if you keep at it, you should become more comfortable with the language and the test format.
